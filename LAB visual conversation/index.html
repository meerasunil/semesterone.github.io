  <div><h1>Charlie Laughs</h1>
   Uh huh.<br>
    Uh huh.<br>
    I thought I pay Nora.<br>
    Well, I’m going broke too if
that’s any help. I’ve just agreed
to direct two shitty plays and we
can forget putting anything away
for Henry’s college.<br>
Uh huh.<br>
Sounds awful <br> 
I know. I feel the same way. <br>
You’ll remember I said this to you at the beginning. <br>
I was anticipating these circumstances-- <br>
(pause) OK. <br> 
There’s a long silence. They both laugh. <br>
I don’t know how to start... <br>
<p>No</p><br>
I don’t understand it. <br>
We discussed things. We were married, we said things. We talked about moving to Europe, about getting a sideboard or what do you call it, a credenza, to fill that empty space behind the couch. We never did any of it.<br>
It wasn’t something I wanted. We had a great theater company and a great life where we were.<br>
You know what I mean. <br>
Don’t pretend you’re not capable of deception. You left Ben for ME. <br>
<h1> NICOLE </h1> Well, that’s the problem isn’t it? I was your wife, you should have considered my happiness too. <br>
<h1> CHARLIE </h1> <br> Come on! You WERE happy. You’ve just decided you weren’t now-- <br>
And I agreed to put Henry in school here because your show went to series. I did that KNOWING that when you were done shooting, he would come back to New York... <br>
We did say it. <br>
I don’t know when we said it, but we said it! <br>
(remembering something) We said it that time on the phone-- <br>
I was not privy to that thought process. <br>
OK, you wish you hadn’t married me, you wish you’d had a different life. But this is what happened. <br>
I don’t know. <br>
<p>Fuck Nora.</p> I hate fucking Nora telling me I always lived in LA even though I never lived in LA. How could you have her say those things about me? <br>
I needed my own asshole! <br>
Nora was worse. <br>
You pulled the rug out from under me and you’re putting me through hell-- <br>
Is that what that was? Hell? <br>
It’s not what I want...I mean, it’s what I want, but it’s what was...WAS...what’s best for him <br>
<p>Oh, fuck off-- </p><br>
Stop putting your feelings about me onto Henry. <br>
He tells you because he knows it’s what you want to HEAR! <br>
Because I’m going through a divorce in LA and trying to direct a play in New York. <br>
Which closed because I wasn’t THERE! That was a HUGE opportunity for me. For the theater. And I let everyone down. <br>
DO NOT compare me to my father <br>
You’re exactly like your mother! Everything you complain about her, you’re doing. You’re suffocating Henry. <br>
I’m just repeating what you’ve told me-- <br>
You ARE! And you’re like my father. You’re also like MY mother. You’re all the bad things about all of these people. But mostly your mother. When we would lie in bed together, sometimes I would look at you and see HER and just feel so GROSS. <br>
You’re a slob. I made all the beds, closed all the cabinets, picked up after you like an infant-- <br>
<p>You’ll never be happy.</p> In LA or anywhere. You’ll think you found some better, opposite guy than me and in a few years you’ll rebel against him because you need to have your VOICE. But you don’t WANT a voice. You just want to fucking complain about not having a VOICE. <br>
<p>You’ve regressed.</p> You’ve gone back to your life before you met me. It’s pathetic. <br>
<h1> NICOLE </h1> People used to say to me that you were too selfish to be a great artist. I used to defend you. But they’re absolutely right. <br>
<h1> CHARLIE </h1> You want to present yourself as a victim because it’s a good <p>legal strategy</p>, FINE. But you and I both know you CHOSE this life. You wanted it until you didn’t. <h1> Nicole is silent. CHARLIE</h1> You USED me so you could get out of LA.><br>
You did and then you BLAMED me for it. You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short. Life with you was JOYLESS. <br>
You shouldn’t be upset that I fucked her, <p>you should be upset that I had a laugh with her.</p> <br>
No! But she didn’t hate me. You hated me. <br>
You stopped having sex with me in the last year. <p> I never cheated on you.</p> <br>
But there’s so much I could have done. I was a director in my 20’s who came from nothing and was suddenly on the cover of fucking Time Out New York. I was hot shit—-and I wanted to fuck EVERYBODY and I didn’t. And I loved you and didn’t want to lose you...and I’m in my twenties and I didn’t want to lose that too. And you wanted SO much so fast...I didn’t even want to get married...and fuck it, there’s so much I DIDN’T do. <br>
You’re welcome. You’re...welcome. Nicole stamps her feet and shakes her fists like a child having a tantrum. <br>
You’re fucking insane! Charlie raises his arm and punches the wall. The cheap drywall cracks and chips. And you’re fucking winning. <br>
(pause) What does that have to do with LA? Nicole stares at him, incredulous. What? <br>
Every day I wake up and hope you’re dead-- <p>Dead like</p>-- And then Charlie starts crying. (through tears) If I could guarantee Henry would be OK, I’d hope you get an illness and then get hit by a car and DIE. He sinks down, weeping. All this vitriol has taken its toll. Nicole watches, <p>taken aback.</p> She walks over and gently puts her hand on his shoulder. He shakes and cries. <br> 




</div>
<div> <h1>Nicole smiles</h1>
    So... I thought we should talk<br>
I feel like maybe things have gone too far.<br>
I mean, my mom has taken out a loan against the house to help me pay Nora <br>
You pay thirty percent of Nora.<br>
(trying not to take the
bait)
It’s just that...up until now
we’ve been able to keep Henry at
least somewhat removed. And this
will change that.<br>
And we have to protect him.<br>
Nora says the evaluator will come
into our homes. She’ll interview
Henry in addition to us, our
family, friends, enemies... And
then she’ll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.<br>
I know! I feel like if anyone observed me on any given day as a mom, I’d never get custody. (pause) That was a joke. <br>
<p>(smiles)</p> Right. So, maybe we can figure something out between us- <br>
I know you did, but these are different circumstances-- <br>
Mm hm. Anyway... Shall we try this? <br>
Do you understand why I want to stay in LA? <br>
Well, that’s not...Charlie, that’s not a useful way for us to start—<br>
You don’t remember promising that we could do time out here? <br>
And you turned down that residency at the Geffen that would have brought us here and-- <br>
You call that a great life <br>
Me discovering you’re fucking Mary Ann—<br>
<h1> CHARLIE </h1> I don’t mean we had a great marriage. I mean, life in Brooklyn... Professionally. I don’t know. Honestly I never considered anything different. <br>
NICOLE (not taking the bait) So, OK, let’s... I work here now. My family is here. <br>
<p>Honey,</p>we never said that. That might have been your assumption, but we never expressly said that... <br>
When did we say it? <br>
I thought-- <br>
Let me finish. <p>Honey</p>-- (hesitates, <p> angry </p> at herself) Sorry, I keep saying THAT. (resumes) I thought...that if Henry was happy out here and my show continued, that we might do LA for a while. <br>
The only reason we didn’t live here was because you can’t imagine desires other than your own unless they’re forced on you. <br>
(trying to stay calm) So what do we do? <br>
Nora says there’s no coming back from this. <br>
Jay said them about me too! (hesitates) You shouldn’t have fired Bert. <br>
Let’s both agree both of our lawyers have said shitty stuff about both of us-- <br>
Jay called me an alcoholic! <br>
You put me through hell DURING the marriage! <br> 
And now you're going to put Henry through this horrible thing so you can yet again get what you want. <br>
I was wondering when you’d get around to Henry and what HE actually wants. <br>
No, YOU fuck off. If you listened to your son, or anyone, he’d tell you he’d rather live here. <br>
He tells me he likes it here better. <br>
He tells me you’re on the phone all the time. You don’t even play with him. <br>
You’re fighting for something you don’t even WANT. <br>
You’re being so much like your father. <br>
I didn’t compare you. I said you were acting like him. <br>
First of all, I love my mother, she was a great mother! <br>
Secondly, how dare you compare my mothering to my mother? I might be like my father, but I’m NOT like my mother. <br>
I felt <p>repulsed</p> when you <p>touched</p>me. <br>
The thought of having sex with you makes me want to peel my skin off. <br>
I think of being married to you and that woman is a stranger to me. <br>
We had a child’s marriage. <br>
</div>

<div> 
    <h1> CHARLIE </h1> All your best acting is behind you. You’re back to being a HACK. <br>
    <h1> NICOLE </h1> You gaslighted me. You’re a fucking villain. <br>
    I didn’t use you-- <br>
    So you had to fuck someone else? How could you? <br> 
    Do you <p>love her?</p> <br>
    <p>You hated ME.</p> You fucked someone we worked with. <br>
    That was cheating on me. <br> 
    Well, thanks for that. <br>
    I can’t believe I have to know you FOREVER! <br>
    Are you kidding? I wanted to be married. I’d ALREADY LOST. (sadly) You didn’t love me as much as I loved you. <br>
    You’re so merged with your own selfishness that you don’t even identify it as selfishness anymore. YOU’RE SUCH A DICK. <br>
    I know. Finally, he looks up at her. <br>
